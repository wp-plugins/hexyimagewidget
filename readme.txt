A haxy widget that makes it a breeze to add images to your sidebars and set the image as “follow” or “nofollow”.

== Description ==

Haxy Image Widget is a simple image sidebar widget you can add on your sidebar, the speciality of this image widget is that it can be set as “nofollow” so the Search engine will not follow the link.
"Nofollow" provides a way for webmasters to tell search engines "Don't follow links on this page" or "Don't follow this specific link."
